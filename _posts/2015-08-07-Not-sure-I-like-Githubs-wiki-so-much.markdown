So, I'm not so sure I like GitHub's wiki so much, after all
=============================================================

Looks like there's no way to execute a search, so you're reduced to stumbling around from linked page to linked page, trying to find what you're interested in.

:(

So, what to do?  I could keep on building [org-mode](orgmode.org) files, and that
might actually be the best bet.

Or I could find a way to make a zillion little Jekyll files here in another folder,
and figure out how to refer to them.

If I take the latter approach, is searchability any better? Apparently so.  Check this out:

Or maybe I should just continue to use Evernote, but better.
