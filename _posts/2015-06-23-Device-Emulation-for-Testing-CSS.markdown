excerpt: Device emulation in Chrome for testing CSS on small screens
tags: CSS

So, you can do this:

!["Device mode" button in Chrome's developer tools](/images/device-emulation-in-chrome.png)

This is in Chrome's "Developer Tools" console, which you can bring up with ctrl-shift-I or by hitting Chrome's menu and
selecting More Tools | Developer Tools.

When you hit that button, Chrome pretends to be a handheld device (and you can set the screen dimensions yourself, if
you need to), so you can see how your web site will look on that device.
