Managed to get an RSS feed going
=================================

So, I managed to get an RSS feed running through Jekyll, following the instructions at
[https://help.github.com/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages/](https://help.github.com/articles/atom-rss-feeds-for-github-pages/)

Also, updated my Ruby to 2.2.3 from 1.9.3.  The Ubuntu package manager still only supports 1.9.3?  What the heck?

That was a surprisingly lengthy update, especially when followed by `bundle update`.
