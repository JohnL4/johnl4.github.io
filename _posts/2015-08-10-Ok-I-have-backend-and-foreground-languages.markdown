I have chosen my backend and frontend technologies (Haskell and Angular/Polymer)
================================================================================

So, how hard can the rest be?

I need a Haskell web server.

And I need to figure out how to write code in the frontend that talks to the backend.

And I need database.  Postgres, I guess, on my local server.  Firebase, if not Postgres.

Let's go back to frontend processing: Polymer. Let's make something in Polymer.

Bower

Of course.  There's Something Else I Have To Do First (tm). >:(

### NPM

Oh, but before you install Bower, you have to install something _else_ first.

(And git, too, but I'm guessing you already have that.  If not, it's not that hard, go get it: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/))

Polymer Starter Kit
-------------------

Seems like this would be a good idea.
