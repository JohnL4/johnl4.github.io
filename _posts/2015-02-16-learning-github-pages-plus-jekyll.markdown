Moar GitHub Jekyll Learning
===========================

Peeve #3 or so
-----------------

Farking smart quotes.  Why does something that prides itself on "plain and simple" make me struggle with smart quotes,
doubled dashes and ellipses turning into weird sh...tuff?  It's not aimed at non-technical people who just want to blog
because it has a *ton* of learning required and setup effort (unless you're already a developer used to working with
Jekyll and github-pages), so that target audience is precluded.  Developer and other technical types will probably
already want a straight single quote mark to just frikkin *stay* that way.  Plain text, my left hind leg.  >:(

I have this Jekyll blog thingie set up so that front matter is optional at the top of each post, BUT... if you put some
front matter up there (delimited top and bottom by three dashes, as shown below), then you can set your own "excerpt"
[how long can it be?] without polluting your actual blog entry with that header stuff.

For example, this is at the top of this very file:
