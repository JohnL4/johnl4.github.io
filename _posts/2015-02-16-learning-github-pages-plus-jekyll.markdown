Moar GitHub Jekyll Learning
===========================

Peeve #3 or so
-----------------

Farking smart quotes.  Why does something that prides itself on "plain and simple" make me struggle with smart quotes,
doubled dashes and ellipses turning into weird sh...tuff?  It's not aimed at non-technical people who just want to blog
because it has a *ton* of learning required and setup effort (unless you're already a developer used to working with
Jekyll and github-pages), so that target audience is precluded.  Developer and other technical types will probably
already want a straight single quote mark to just frikkin *stay* that way.  Plain text, my left hind leg.  >:(
