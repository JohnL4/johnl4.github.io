excerpt: This is my test excerpt, along with some playing around with italics and bold and whatnot.  Consider this to be
         the playground.  Say, how long can my excerpt be, anyway?  The answer is, _as long as you want_, so long as you
         indent subsequent lines and don't use colons anywhere (what the heck?).  Nice!
