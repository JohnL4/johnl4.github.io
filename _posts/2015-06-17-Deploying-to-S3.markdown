Deploying to an Amazon S3 bucket
================================


So, I currently have a public folder, reachable at http://s3.amazonaws.com/_PublicFolderName_.  (I wonder if I should
change the name of that folder to something that's not my name?)

The folder isn't browsable, but stuff in it is publicly viewable, so it's just a matter of uploading to the folder and
linking to the right URL.

Uploading
---------

The AWS console has an "Upload" function, but is there a command-line tool I can use?

Why, _yes_, there does indeed appear to be!
