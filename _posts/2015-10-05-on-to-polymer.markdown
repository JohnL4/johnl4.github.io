On To Polymer!
==============

So, in my quest for a usable animated sidebar (see the most-recent Bootstrap post), I've decide
Polymer may have more to offer than Bootstrap.

Let's see if we can get a static page working w/Polymer.

On my Mac (since that's where I happen to be at the moment):

~~~
brew install npm # Since I didn't already have it.
npm install -g bower # Since I didn't have Bower
~~~

...and so on.  It's pretty easy to get Polymer Starter Kit 1.1.1 working.
