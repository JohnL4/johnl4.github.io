* Online class/API docs

  - Jekyll: http://www.rubydoc.info/github/mojombo/jekyll/Jekyll/Post
  - Ruby: http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html#method-i-strftime

  Maybe?  Not sure how well these docs match the versions of whatever software you download.

* Ruby =gem install jekyll-docs= failures

  If you get this error: =Could not find a valid gem 'jekyll-docs' (>= 0) in any repository=, check
  to make sure you can ping =rubygems.org=.

  In the case of jekyll-docs specifically, you need to throw the =--pre= switch in (as of
  2015-02-16):

  : sudo gem install jekyll-docs --pre

  Of course, it still doesn't work.  Oh, well.

* DONE Turning off the "smart" punctuation

    Problem was entity output =:as_char=, not smart quotes.  Github pages actually use smart quotes, if
    you look closely.

  Look at this:

  [[file:images/smart-punctuation-problems.png]]

  So, we need to find a way to turn off the "smart" punctuation.  (You'll note that emacs org-mode
  doesn't have any trouble generating good html, out of the box.  Of course, I'd probably have to
  struggle to make it generate "smart" punctuation, but, hey, if I wanted that, I'd probably not be
  using org-mode.  So, there.)

  Well... looks like the Jekyll processor on github /does/ actually not make the smart quotes, so I
  just to find out how to do that on my local Jekyll server.  smart -- dash?  (Neet!  org-mode turns
  both the ellipsis and the doubled dash into (the right) html entities!)

  Here's a link:

** DONE Default markdown processor is...

   ...apparently, *kramdown*.  See http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#default-configuration.

** Problem was entity output, not smart quoting
   
   Looks like the fix is as follows:
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   kramdown:
     entity_output: :symbolic
     # smart_quotes: ["apos", "apos", "quot", "quot"]
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   The problem isn't the smart quotes, it's the fact that entity output defaults to =:as_char=,
   (http://kramdown.gettalong.org/rdoc/Kramdown/Options.html) which generates some very odd stuff if
   your file is just plain text (ASCII)?
   
   Looks like the characters served up by the github servers are interpreted correctly while the same
   characters off the local jekyll server get interpreted differently.  Different page
   languages/encodings?  UTF-8 vs ASCII?

* DONE Need to find a way to style for small (mobile) screens

    Gave up.  Works fine on Android, not on iPhone.

  If you go through the github auto page generation drill, you can choose a style, which will result
  in a stylesheet being stuffed into your repository.  Said stylesheet has small-screen settings, so
  figuring out how to style posts should help solve this problem.

** DONE Styling org-mode output
   CLOSED: [2015-02-16 Mon 18:59]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2015-02-16 Mon 18:59] \\
     Use something like the following at the top of your org-mode file:
     
        : #+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
     
     Or you could just not bother.

   If we can figure this out, then maybe we can style org-mode output.  

* DONE Styling posts in Jekyll

  Don't know how yet.  Need layouts and stylesheets.

  Not so hard, in theory.  In =_layouts=, build an html page, reference whatever styles you need
  (declaring them in =stylesheets= if you need to).

** Layouts

   In directory =_layouts=.  Use Liquid tag ={{ content }}= to put post content into your template.

** Stylesheets

   In directory =stylesheets=.
   
** TODO How to get CSS class names into the output of the markdown compiler

   Pre-defined github styles have specific CSS classes that are where the good stuff really
   happens.  If you just invoke the style in the output of a markdown processor (e.g., for posts),
   you'll get bad results, unless you can find a way to tie in to the CSS classes.

  Not technically part of the Jekyll journey, but definitely part of the info-sharing-with-the-world
  journey.

  Well, uh... embarassingly easy.  For your project, there's a link on the right-side toolbar:
