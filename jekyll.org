* Turning off the "smart" punctuation

  Look at this:

  [[file:images/smart-punctuation-problems.png]]

  So, we need to find a way to turn off the "smart" punctuation.  (You'll note that emacs org-mode
  doesn't have any trouble generating good html, out of the box.  Of course, I'd probably have to
  struggle to make it generate "smart" punctuation, but, hey, if I wanted that, I'd probably not be
  using org-mode.  So, there.)
  

* Styling posts in Jekyll

  Don't know how yet.  Need layouts and stylesheets.

** Layouts

   In directory =_layouts=.

** Stylesheets

   In directory =stylesheets=.
