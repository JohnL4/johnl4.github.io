#+TITLE: General Jekyll Notes, Journey of a Noob
* Turning off the "smart" punctuation

  Look at this:

  [[file:images/smart-punctuation-problems.png]]

  So, we need to find a way to turn off the "smart" punctuation.  (You'll note that emacs org-mode
  doesn't have any trouble generating good html, out of the box.  Of course, I'd probably have to
  struggle to make it generate "smart" punctuation, but, hey, if I wanted that, I'd probably not be
  using org-mode.  So, there.)

  Well... looks like the Jekyll processor on github /does/ actually not make the smart quotes, so I
  just to find out how to do that on my local Jekyll server.  smart -- dash?  (Neet!  org-mode turns
  both the ellipsis and the doubled dash into (the right) html entities!)
  

* Styling posts in Jekyll

  Don't know how yet.  Need layouts and stylesheets.

** Layouts

   In directory =_layouts=.

** Stylesheets
